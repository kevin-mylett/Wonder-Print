<h1>Wonder-Print</h1>

This is the repository for the Wonder-Print website. The live website can be found here -> <a href="https://www.wonder-print.co.uk/">https://www.wonder-print.co.uk</a>.

The site uses Wordpress as a CMS. 

The Wonder-Print child theme was solely developed by myself (Kevin Mylett).

The .gitignore file removes all other files (Worpdress Core, plugins etc..)

SASS is used to create the CSS.

Grunt is used as a taskrunner.
